# FsAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## FYI (for FastSpring colleagues)

This is a WIP

- New functionalities!
- - Observables for reactivity
- - Loops for products rendering
- - Product Card components
- All of them are declared in the fastspring.service.ts
- Basic knowledge of JS and some understanding of Typescript is required
- Directives do not work in Angular
